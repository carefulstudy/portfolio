					<h1>Psi Freak FAQs</h1>
					<h2>Can someone tell me what a Psi Freak is?</h2>
					<p>Well, a Psi Freak is a super cool name for someone who has special powers called psionics!
						There are more than 8 different types of psionics,
						and each type can control something awesome,
						like heat, sound, or moisture.
						These amazing people are the stars of the game!</p>
					
					<h2>Why can't I explore beyond certain areas?</h2>
					<p>Some areas in Psi Freak are still fenced off, and here’s why: the game was developed locally over three years, but it hasn’t yet been fully tested online. To make sure everything runs smoothly, we’re opening up new areas one at a time. This way, we can catch and fix any issues, making sure each part is solid before expanding. Thanks for being patient as we build this world together!</p>
					
					<h2>Is it for kids, grown-ups, or both?</h2>
					<p>Psifreak is rated 'E for Everyone,' making it suitable for players aged 6 and up. The game features engaging, playful battles utilizing items such as yo-yos and frisbees, alongside the exciting abilities of psionics. This ensures a delightful and family-friendly experience in a vibrant, imaginative world.</p>
					
					<h2>Is it possible to use real money for extras?</h2>
					<p>No, Psi Freak is dedicated to fostering a fair and enjoyable environment for all players. The game is designed with the principle that players deserve the best experience without the pressure of in-game purchases. I believe in treating the player base with respect, ensuring that everyone can hone their skills and enjoy the game without shortcuts or financial barriers.</p>
					
					<h2>Can I play Psi Freak on systems other than Windows?</h2>
					<p>Currently, Psi Freak is exclusively available on Windows computers. I’m focusing on refining the core technology for the game, and while there may be opportunities to expand to other platforms in the future, for now, Windows users will have the best experience!</p>
					
					<h2>Will Psi Freak be available on Steam?</h2>
					<p>Currently, Psi Freak is only available on itch.io, a platform I appreciate for its support of indie developers and direct connection with players. While Steam has its merits, I feel that itch.io allows for a more personalized and authentic experience. For now, I’m grateful to stay with itch.io, where we can work together to create something special.</p>
					
					<h2>Doesn’t $100 seem a bit much for a game?</h2>
					<p>The $100 price tag helps deter bad actors and ensures a committed player community. Psi Freak is free for anyone who follows the human verification steps mentioned earlier, like sharing original drawings or mentioning Psi Freak in a video. Even if you don’t support financially, I’m grateful you’re playing! Just imagine what this game could become in 50 years! Let’s embark on this journey together</p>
